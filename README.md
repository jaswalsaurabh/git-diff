## Project Structure

- We have 2 folders `client` and `server`
- The `client` directory contains the front-end code for the user interface (UI).
- The `server` directory contains the back-end code for the server.

## Prerequisites

- NodeJs version >= 18.18.2

## Setup Instructions

### Server

1. Navigate to the `server` directory:

    ```sh
    cd server
    ```

2. Install the dependencies:

    ```sh
    npm install
    ```

3. Start the server:

    ```sh
    npm start
    ```

The server will run on [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001) by default.

### Client

1. Navigate to the `client` directory:

    ```sh
    cd client
    ```

2. Install the dependencies:

    ```sh
    npm install
    ```

3. Start the client:

    ```sh

    ```

The client will run on [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) by default.
